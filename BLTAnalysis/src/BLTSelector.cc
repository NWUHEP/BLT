//    Process():      called for each event, in this function you decide what
//                    to read and fill your histograms.
//    Terminate():    called at the end of the loop on the tree,
//                    a convenient place to draw/fit your histograms.

    // via the fObject pointer.

    // This function should contain the "body" of the analysis. It can contain
    // simple or elaborate selection criteria, run algorithms on the data
    // of the event and typically fill histograms.
